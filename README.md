### How to use ?

```python3 htbs.py <last digits of IP>```

You can also modify this in the script  ^ (change that if you're not going to use this for HTB)


### Make it simple

copy this file to your /usr/bin directory then simply run this like

```htbs <last digits of IP>```

### what means last digits ?

Here I made this script friendly for HTB users. So, HTB users can just use the last two/three digits of ip

instead of using full ip ```10.10.10.221``` they can simply use ```221``` 

### Non-HTB users 

You guys need to change the th line of this code
